# DX Lab: Meridian

## Introduction

The State Library of NSW has a unique collection of maps from the 16th and 17th century. The Meridian project seeks to reimagine these maps as interactive 3D globes using  open source web technologies.

This repository contains all code and project files. It is freely available for re-use and reference.

### Maps

- [Miranda's World Map](http://digital.sl.nsw.gov.au/delivery/DeliveryManagerServlet?embedded=true&toolbar=false&dps_pid=IE3538803)
- [Coronelli Terrestrial Globe](http://digital.sl.nsw.gov.au/delivery/DeliveryManagerServlet?embedded=true&toolbar=false&dps_pid=IE3775803)

With more to come...

### Technology

Meridian can be served as a static HTML application. The following Javascript libraries are used:

- [three.js](https://threejs.org)
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org)
- [TweenLite](https://greensock.com/tweenlite)

For local development, Node.js is used in conjunction with the following libraries:

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io/)

## Getting Started

Make sure Node.js is installed, then clone and run:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

Then go to `http://localhost:3001` to see the app in action! `Browsersync` will detect changes in the code and update on the fly.

## Deployment

Just copy the `/public` folder to any server.

Internally, we use `now` for deployments.
